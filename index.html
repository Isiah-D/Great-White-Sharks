        <h2>About Great White Sharks</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Found in cool, coastal waters around the world, great whites are the largest predatory fish on Earth.
            They grow to an average of 15 feet in length,
            though specimens exceeding 20 feet and weighing up to 5,000 pounds have been recorded.</p>
        <p>They have slate-gray upper bodies to blend in with the rocky coastal sea floor, but they get their name from
            their white underbellies.
            They're streamlined, torpedo-shaped swimmers with powerful tails that can propel them through the water at
            speeds of up to 15 miles per hour.
            They can even leave the water completely, breaching like whales when attacking prey from underneath.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Great white sharks are globally distributed with concentrations near South Africa, Australia/New Zealand,
            the North Atlantic, and Northeastern Pacific. However, the great white sharks off the U.S. West Coast are an
            isolated population
            that reside off California and also include individuals off Guadalupe Island, located 150 miles off the west
            coast of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
