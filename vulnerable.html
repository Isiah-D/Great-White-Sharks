        <p>The Great White is the world's largest known predatory fish. This fact may suggest that the species should have no 
            problem fending for itself, right? Unfortunately, the animal is decreasing in numbers and humans are responsible.
            The animal is hunted both for its fins and teeth, and often as a trophy in sport fishing. They also tend to get caught
            in nets used for commercial fishing, along with the meshes that protect beaches. The great white has a conservational
            status of "vulnerable".

        <p>You may be asking: "What can I do to help these awesome creatures?" That's easy. You can donate to a organization that fights
            to protect the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. <a href="https://www.projectaware.org/">Projecet Aware</a> is one of
            those organizations! There's also the Oceanic Preservation Society or 
            <a href="https://www.opsociety.org/take-action/advocacy-actions/sharks-rays/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAst2BBhDJARIsAGo2ldXKGx8PLKKPCueHm-wPvsb9TjIDplOF7wPpyGAOdsrLpMEIZNtsITYaArxcEALw_wcB">OPS</a> for short!
